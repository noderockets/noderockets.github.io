								<h2>Mission Objectives</h2>
								<h3>Here is your mission, if choose to accept it</h3>
							</header>

							<p>The main objective of your team is to build a javascript powered rocket that once launched will record and use
								telemetry data to safely return to earth ready for it’s next mission. Sounds easy enough right? Your rocket will
								consist of the following components:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Engine</li>
								<li>Payload Compartment</li>
								<li>Command Module</li>
								<li>Parachute and Deployment Cover</li>
								<li>Fins</li>
								<li>Nose Cone</li>
								<li>Launcher Platform</li>
							</ul>


							<p>The engine is made from a 2-liter soda bottle and uses water and pressurized air as a propellent. The payload compartment
								is also made from a 2-liter soda bottle and will house the command module. The command module is the computer system
								for the rocket. At its core is a Raspberry Pi running NodeJS. It also contains several sensors that expose their
								data via a node module. Attached to the Pi is a servo which will be used to deploy the parachute. The parachute is
								the simplest component, but may be the most important. Using the data from the sensors you can create a strategy
								for deploying the chute. The fins, nose cone and overall aerodynamic design are critical for achieving the optimal
								flight and highest altitude.</p>

							<p>The launch platform consists of 3 valves for controlling the air, water and launch of the rocket. It also has a
								sensor for calculating the air pressure of the system. The launch platform exposes an API for controlling the valves
								and reading the pressure. You will need to use this API to control the different stages of launch.</p>

							<p>In addition to the main rocket components, their is additional hardware (camera, led lights, gamepad, etc.) that
								you can integrate with the command module or launch platform. It will be your teams job to engineer and incorporate
								at least one additional item as part of your design. Your rocket will compete with other rockets for it’s ability
								to be reusable, reach high altitude and also creativity.</p>


							<ul class="check-list">
								<li>Successfully Launch Rocket</li>
								<li>Deploy Parachute</li>
								<li>Incorporate Specialized Mission Hardware</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Below you will find the critical roles that your team needs to complete this mission. Each role has detailed instructions
								on how to complete its job. You may have multiple people fill each role or have somebody fill multiple roles. It's
								up to you, good luck!</p>

							<h2>Flight Engineer</h2>
							<p>
								Aerodynamics is your speciality. This spacecraft must fly and your job is to design and build a flightworthy craft. Oh yeah,
								don't forget to attach the parachute.

							<h2>Communication Specialist</h2>
							<p>
								You've got the easy job. All you have to do is make sure the parachute deploys when it's suppossed to. Oh yeah, the president
								called and wants some kindof fancy dashboard to see the data.
