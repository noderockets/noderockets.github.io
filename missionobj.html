								<h2>Mission Objectives</h2>
								<h3>Here is your mission, if choose to accept it</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The main objective of your team is to build a javascript powered rocket that once launched will return safely to earth. Using
								a 2-liter soda bottle as the engine for your rocket, it will use pressurized water and air as it's propellent and
								can reach heights of several hundred feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Onboard the rocket (and preferrably in a seperate and dry compartment) is the command module. The command module is made
								up of a Raspberry Pi running NodeJS, a 6-axis motion sensor, a temperature sensor, an altimeter and a servo. Using
								the hardware provided and the data stream from the sensors, you must figure out a strategy for depolying the parachute
								so that the rocket will safely land.
							</p>

								MORE, MORE, MORE
